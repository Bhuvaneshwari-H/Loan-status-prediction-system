Loan status prediction is the process of using data and machine learning algorithms to forecast whether a borrower will repay a loan or default. It helps financial institutions assess risk, make informed lending decisions, and prevent potential losses. By analyzing factors such as credit history, income, and employment, predictive models provide valuable insights into the likelihood of loan repayment, aiding in responsible lending practices and reducing financial risks. This predictive approach enhances efficiency and accuracy in the loan approval process.
